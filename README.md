## Key Features

[LSX Design](https://lsx.design/) is a WordPress block theme that is light-weight & responsive. Users are able to use the theme to create fast, efficient and attractive websites by using the WordPress's Block Editor and Site Editor. We've built it to be fully compatible with WooCommerce, making it an ideal choice for your next eCommerce build. Its lightweight build ensures better load times, a bonus for both user experience and SEO. LSX has been designed to be minimal and lean, while still having rich customizer options, like allowing you to control fonts, color options, home page configuration, widget areas and much more.
